# faux-notifications
WIP - Library to create custom desktop notifications in NW.js

This is a placeholder repo for a library.

Initial features would include:

* Simple API
* Ability to set position of the notification (default being bottom right on Win, top right on Lin/OSX)
* Set an auto-close timeout

Future features could include:

* Handling stacking of multiple notifications
